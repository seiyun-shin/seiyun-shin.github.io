Hello everyone! I am a Ph.D. student in the ECE department at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I am under the supervision of [Prof. Ilan Shomorony](http://www.ilanshomorony.com/) and [Prof. Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/). My research is partly supported by [Kwanjeong Educational Foundation Fellowship](http://en.ikef.or.kr) and [Mavis Future Faculty Fellow](https://mavis.grainger.illinois.edu/people/groups/current-mavis-fellow/) from UIUC. Prior to joining UIUC, I received my M.S. degree from the department of Electrical Engineering at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) (KAIST). I studied information theory under the supervision of [Prof. Changho Suh](http://csuh.kaist.ac.kr/). I also graduated Summa Cum Laude, earning B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics (double-major) from KAIST.

I also spent time in [Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri) (ETRI), a government-funded research institute in South Korea, as part of my mandatory military service.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

I seek to gain insight into fundamental problems that are practically relevant. My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical machine learning, algorithm design, and information theory. Within these disciplines, I seek to achieve two closely-related goals. One is to characterize the fundamental limits of the amount and quality of data required for reliable estimation and learning; the other is to develop computationally efficient algorithms that can provably achieve these limits. Specifically, I am working on establishing sample complexity in GraphML (e.g., graph neural networks), instance-adaptive algorithms, and multi-armed bandits.
